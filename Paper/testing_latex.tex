  We propose an algorithm to select the kernel bandwidths that is faster when compare
  to the standards approaches and is scalable in the number of variables. The standard
  methods select the bandwidth by using derivative free optimization and rely
  on computing the generalization error based on LOO. This optimization technique does
  not scale to the number of variables and the generalization error based on LOO
  is highly biased. We circumvent both problems by posing an optimization problem
  that computes a better generalization error and that uses the gradient to efficiently
  explore the parameter space.
